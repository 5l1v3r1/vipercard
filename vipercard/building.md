### How to build ViperCard:

- install node.js

- download vipercard source

- cd to vipercard/vipercard

- run npm install

- run npm run start

- webpack will do its thing, and after ~30s of compiling, a browser and vipercard will open

### Running tests

- open the JavaScript console. you may have to 'show development tools' in browser settings.

- press Option+Shift+T

- test status should be shown. eventually expected to see a message like "261/261. all tests pass."

### Production build

- run npm run build

- output will be written to ./dist
