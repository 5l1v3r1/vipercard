    ui512 is my general-purpose user-interface layer, remembering when screen resolutions were 512x342.
    
    ui512 can be used as a standalone library for another gpl project, see uidemobasic.ts for a "hello world" example 
    
    vpc contains the script parser and interpreter. I wrote a custom python script to assist in writing the Chevrotain grammar.
    
    vpcui is ViperCard's user interface.
