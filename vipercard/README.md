- [homepage](https://www.vipercard.net) - ViperCard runs in any modern web browser

- [complete script reference](doc/reference_01_fundamentals.md) - what's available when making a project in ViperCard

Source code:

- `./vipercard/src/ui512` is my user-interface layer, remembering when screen resolutions were 512x342. it can be used as a standalone library for another project. 

- `./vipercard/src/vpc` contains the script parser and interpreter

- `./vipercard/src/vpcui` is ViperCard's user interface
