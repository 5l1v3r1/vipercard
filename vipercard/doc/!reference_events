(Included for compatibility, unlikely to be useful for writing scripts).

Certain error messages create an errorDialog event. The default response is
to show a script error at the offending line. If you write your own errorDialog
handler you can catch these events. However, because most errors do not
go through errorDialog, this is unlikely to be useful.
