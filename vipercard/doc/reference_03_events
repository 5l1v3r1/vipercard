To get faster idle calls, at the expense of heavier cpu usage,
use
`set the idlerate to "faster"`

when the mouse is pressed down onto the object, and released on

=====
on___afterKeyDown
=====

Called when a key is pressed.
You can use the functions `keyChar()`,  `shiftKey()`,  `optionKey()`, 
and `commandKey()`, to determine which key(s) where pressed.

`keyRepeated()` can be used to see if the key event comes from
the key having been held down.

Examples:

on afterKeyDown
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyDown
=====
on___afterKeyUp
=====

Called when a key is pressed and released.
You can use the functions keyChar(), shiftKey(), optionKey(), and
commandKey(), to determine which key(s) where pressed.

Examples:

on afterKeyUp
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyUp
