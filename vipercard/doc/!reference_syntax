if/then
=====

        Use to run certain code based on a condition that can be true or false.

        In the example

        `
        put 2 into x
        if x > 0 then
            answer "x is greater than 0"
        end if`

        First, we'll check the expression `x > 0`. Since it evaluates to true,
        the code inside is run. 

        You can also include an "else" section that will be run only if the expression evaluated to false.

        `if x > 0 then
            answer "x is greater than 0"
        else
            answer "x is not greater than 0"
        end if`

        You can chain together many different conditions with "else if". 

        `
        put 3 into x
        if x > 3 then
            answer "x is greater than 3"
        else if x < 3 then
            answer "x is less than 3"
        else if x is 3 then
            answer "x is 3"
        end if`

        Like in other programming languages, as soon as one of the branches
        is taken, all of the remaining branches are skipped -- even if the condition is true.

        `
        if 3+3 is 6 then
            answer "aaa"
        else if 2+2 is 4 then
            -- this not run, even though the expression is true
            answer "bbb"
        end if
        `

       This is implemented in 0.3.
       
        Examples:
        
        if 3+3 is 6 then answer "it is"
        
        -- you can even do this
        
        if 3+3 is 7 then answer "it is not"
        else answer "it is"
