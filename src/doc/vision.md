Creativity and technology are often linked. Scientific breakthroughs can arise from accidental playful discoveries. Software has so much potential as a vehicle of creative expression -- you can build quick prototypes and iterations, actions can be stored and undone, platforms are essentially deterministic, there are no parts to order, variable costs are near-zero, and ideas shared quickly. Writing software should be a potential way of self-expression for any number of people regardless of background, just as it has impacted my life. We are moving in this direction, but even in the current age that celebrates coding and builds code camps and impressive free online tutorials, I feel that we're not yet in the right place.

There are many barriers. Factors of location and environment are strong; others have written about this more effectively than I, but here is what I have seen first-hand. Ten years ago, when I lived in a rural area, I volunteered my time writing scheduling software for a school district, and soon realized that many families did not have internet access. Our government is just this month canceling plans to allow internet service to reach rural areas. In TEALS presentations I learned that 75% of US high schools do not even have a single class to teach programming. Increasing action to address these problems is needed. I’m not saying people under economic injustice should just “learn to code” -- I'm saying that we who have access to technology are often unaware of the difficulty of having stabile access to technology in fragile circumstances and abandoned communities. And even once access to technology is present, there are cultural barriers. Programming is mythologized so that only those seen as having a certain type of “intelligence” are encouraged to pursue it. This affects many groups, including the elderly. There are so many positive initiatives and energy in the right direction towards helping people, but they fight against the tide of years of accumulated software development complexity, cultural stereotypes, strong opinions about what who should use which development toolkits, and unhelpful learning environments that assume large amounts of prior knowledge.

I'm sure there were countless problems with software and accessibility in the 80s and early 90s, which were before my time. But I am fascinated by the idea that the line between “user” and “programmer” was so blurred. You set up your Commodore 64 and typed in its software, line by line. You shared fun BASIC scripts with your friends, and even made your own modifications! Self-expression and self-efficacy are important. These computers had an incredibly difficult learning curve, but they also gave the dignity of assuming the user was capable of learning to not only operate, but transform and create. And HyperCard on the Macintosh did this even more amazingly.

Our lives (social, career, entertainment) center around software -- but we are discouraged from learning how this software truly works. It is stressful at a deep level. We are made into inadequate, passive consumers, when software has the potential to be so much more.

ViperCard is, in part, my effort to push us to consider that an old black-and-white program from the 90s can inspire us to look for what modern software development is missing.

# Caveats

Current shortcomings that are not yet addressed:

- A gradual step-by-step introduction to scripting is planned.

- By drawing the UI from scratch, ViperCard is currently not compatible with screen readers and accessibility tools.

- ViperCard is currently not compatible with mobile or tablet, despite the importance of these platforms.

- Internal documentation is not yet written for how to extend ViperCard to add wholly new JavaScript commands.
