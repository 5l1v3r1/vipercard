Source code for ViperCard.net.

    Refactoring is scheduled to take place 3/29/18, to better organize this code.

    ui512 is my general-purpose user-interface layer, remembering when screen resolutions were 512x342.
    
    vpcscript is the script parser and interpreter. I wrote a custom python script to help generate the Chevrotain grammar.
    
    vpcui is the ViperCard-specific user interface.
